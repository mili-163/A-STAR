# Multi-Modal Learning with Non-IID Missing Modalities

This repository implements a robust multi-modal learning framework that handles non-IID missing modalities through:
1. Canonical Semantic Topology Construction
2. Geometric Rectification via Soft-Cluster Evolution
3. Adaptive Dual-Stream Structural Restoration

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```
